The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a Web app created with React,Javascript,CSS and HTML to display a range of popular sorting algorithms in real time. The current version of the app contains 4 sorting algorithms which are Quicksort, Heapsort, MergeSort and Bubble Sort. The app uses an array filled with random integer values ranging from 0 - 850 and can have a max size between 5 - 200. The Visualizer also has 3 different speeds at which to sort at and the sizes of each integer bar will resize with the appropriate choosen size of the array.
