# QuadDoggo Project
 
 QuadDoggo is a on going project where the main goal is to learn how to develop and design qudrauped robot. QuadDoggo is a quadruped robot with enhanced mobility such as walking,
 squatting, and running. This project is currently in progress and designs are subject to change.
 
## Current Design 

The current design uses 8 geared DC motors to control 8 axis around the rover (2 motors per leg). I am currently developing 1 leg for testing to make sure that the robot can hold itself up. From there, I can calculate the maximum weight of my Doggo. Below is the current design of the leg that is being produced. It uses belt pully systems with a 1:1 to transfer motion throughout the Doggo's leg.

## Version 1 (Servo)

The first design of the QuadDoggo was created with servo-based joints. These joints proved to be too weak for the Doggo and therefore, the Doggo was redesigned to fit requirements.
