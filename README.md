# QuadDoggo Project
 QuadDoggo is a on going project where the main goal is to learn and reserach quadruped robot design.
 QuadDoggo is a quadruped robot with enhanced mobility such as walking, squatting, and running. This project is currently in progress and designs are subject to change.


## Current Design 

The current designs uses 8 geared DC motors to control 8 Degrees of Freedom. I am currently developing 1 leg for testing to make sure that the robot can hold itself up. From there, I can calculate the maximum weight that my Doggo can be.
