The current designs uses 8 geared DC motors to control 8 Degrees of Freedom. I am currently developing 1 leg for testing to make sure that the robot can hold itself up. From there, I can calculate the maximum weight that my Doggo can be. Below is the current design of the leg that is being produced. It uses 

## Version 1 (Servo)

The first design of the QuadDoggo was created with servo-based joints. These joints proved to be too weak for the Doggo and therefore, the Doggo was redesigned to fit requirements.
