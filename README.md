# QuadDoggo Project
 
 QuadDoggo is a on going project where the main goal is to learn how to develop and design qudrauped robot. QuadDoggo is a quadruped robot with enhanced mobility such as walking,
 squatting, and running. This project is currently in progress and designs are subject to change.
 
## Current Design 

The current design will uses 8 DC motors in total (2 per leg) where each motor has a maximun torque of 4 Nm. I am currently building 1 leg for testing to make sure that the robot can hold itself up. From there, I can calculate the maximum weight of my Doggo and design around that. Below is the current design of the leg that is being produced.

It uses belt pully system with a 1:1 teeth ratio to transfer motion throughout the Doggo's leg. The motor have already been geared down to 32 rpm which is why no additional spped reduction is needed.


### Prototype (Updated 10/13/2020)

Version 1 Test | Version 2 Test

Notice how version 1 requires more torque since most of the motor weight is contained within the leg(I added the blue bag as more weight to keep the leg in place).
Now, notice how version 2 has less contained mass but requires less torque to manipulate. 

## Version 1 (Servo)

The first design of the QuadDoggo was created with servo-based joints. These joints proved to be too weak for the Doggo and therefore, the Doggo was redesigned to fit requirements.

### Prototype (Servo)

First time testing the leg with a Arduino. As you can see, I used a ton of tap to keep the assembly together.
